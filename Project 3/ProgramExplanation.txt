I was able to build a working mymalloc.c file, but was unable to fully implement a 
best-fit algorithm. The function will loop through to find if a given space exactly
fits the requested size, but otherwise, just finds the next portion of free space
that is able to accomadate the malloc, and takes it, splitting off the remaining 
portion into a new free'd space.
